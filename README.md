# whatToWatch 

## SPA that helps you find something to watch.

### how it works:

- collect inputs from the form in redux store (state)
- fetch movies according to form inputs
- display fetched movies with a trailer button
- trailer button click -> fetch trailer src
- render trailer 

## TODO

- nicer fonts
- design for mobile and all screen sizes
    - too small screens: trailer width too wide
    - buttons too small
    - trailer not in the middle of screen, you have to scroll sometimes to find the trailer


## Done

- handling no trailer available
- handling fetch states
- loading animation
- every listItem needs an id
