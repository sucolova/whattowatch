# whatToWatch 

## SPA to find something to watch.

### how it works:

- collect inputs from the form in redux store (state)
- fetch movies according to form inputs
- display fetched movies with a trailer button
- trailer button click -> fetch trailer src
- render trailer 

## TODO

- every listItem needs an id
- nicer fonts
- design for mobile and all screen sizes
    - too small screens: trailer width too wide
    - buttons too small


## Done

- handling no trailer available
- handling fetch states
- loading animation
